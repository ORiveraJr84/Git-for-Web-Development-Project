1. What is Semantic HTML?
    Semantic HTML is HTML Markup that makes sense. It's descriptive. It attempts to give you some basic information about what you're seeing. For example, the <footer> tag attempts to convey that you are at the bottom of the webpage.
    2. What is HTML used for? 
        HTML is used to mark up the various sections of a website telling the various browsers how to treat the content.
    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
        An attribute is a portion of a tag that gives more information as to what that tag is or what it does. For example, an <a> tag simply states that the text between it contains a link but without the "href" attribute, it would not know where it is linking to.
    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
        The <h1> tag should only really be used once. While it's not a hard and fast rule it is common practice. It is meant to be what the overall site is about.
    5. Name two tags that have required attributes
        An <a> tag requires an attribute of "href" as mentioned before so that we know where the link is pointing us to. Similarly, the <img> tag requires an "src" attribute so that the browser knows where it's getting the image from.
    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
        We can put lots of things in the <head> of our website. Some common things would be links to various script files, css files, and things like favicon info.
    7. What is an id? 
        An id is a unique identifier of an element similar to a name for a person. For example there may be many TL's, many of them may be female, but there's only one... Aja Blanco! üòÇ
    8. What elements can I add an id to?
        You can add an id to any element. 
    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
        While this is also not a hard and fast rule, an id should only ever be used once. Just like people are all unique, so are id's.
    10. What is a class? 
        A class is a generic label you can use to describe elements that should be styled similarly. For example, you may have many squares on your website but only certain ones should be blue. You can create a class that would render all of them blue at the same time by making sure that the square elemts are in the same class.
    11. What elements can I add a class to? 
        You can add a class to any element.
    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 
        You can use a class an infinite number of times on the webpage.
    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
        To get a link to open in a new tab add the attribute "target=_blank" any <a> tag.
    14. What is the alt attribute in the image tag used for?
        the "alt" attribute is used to help those that are visually impaired and use a screen reader to relay a description of the image. 
    15. How do I reference an id?
        I'm guessing this is asking how to reference it in a CSS file. To reference an id type a hastag or pound sign or tic-tac-toe sign "#" followed by the id. For example to refence an element with an id of "ajaBlanco", just type "#ajaBlanco" in your CSS.
    16. What is the difference between a section and a div?
        A <section> is more semantic and therefore, by definition, more descriptive than a <div>. A <div> can be any part of the website the developer would like to keep together, most likely for styling purposes, that may not necessarily go together.
    17. What is CSS used for? 
        CSS is used to style a webpage.
    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
        To select an element you would simply need to type it followed by open and closed curly braces "{}".
    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
        A class is generic while an id is specific. You may have a class of TL's, and many of them might be classed as female, but only one will have the id of... you guessed it... "wesleySnipes"! What?! You thought I was gonna say "ajaBlanco"? üòÇ
    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
        Again, I'm guessing this is asking how to reference it in a CSS file. To reference a class type a period or dot symbol "." followed by the class. For example to refence an element with an class of "nonRegularTL", just type "nonRegularTL" in your CSS.
    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of ‚Äúhuman‚Äù?
        To select a <p> element with a class fo human you would type in p.human and then open and close the curly braces "{}".
    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 
        A parent child selector is a way to select all elements that are within or nested inside of another element. for example, if you wanted to select all of the paragraph or <p> elements within a <footer> element, you write it as footer > p {}.
    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
        To select all links within a div with the class of sidebar, you would type div > a.sidebar {}.
    24. What is a pseudo selector?
        A pseudo selector is a way of selecting an alternate state of that element. For example, you could select a button and style that but you can also select a button when it's in a state of being hovered over and then style that as well.
    25. What do we use the change the spacing between lines?
        To change the space between lines you would type line-height: with a value afterwards.
    26. What do we use to change the spacing between letters?
        To change the space between letters we would type letter-spacing: with a vale afterwards.
    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize?
        To change everything to capital letters we would type text-transform: followed by the keywords: uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize respectively.
    28. How do I add a 1px border around my div that is dotted and black?
        To add that specific border you would type border: 1px dotted black within the curly braces of the element selected.
    29. How do I select everything on the page?
        To select everything on the page you would type * {}. 
    30. How do I write a comment in CSS?
        To comment something in CSS, write your comment between */ and /* symbols. Everything contained within will not render to the screen.
    31. How do I find out what file I am in, when I am using the command line?
        If you type the "pwd" command into your command line, it will display the path to the file you're currently working in.
    32. Using the command line - how do I see a list of files/folders in my current folder?
        If you type the "ls" command it will return a list of files and folders in your current folder.
    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this?
        To remove a file via command line you would need to type "rm" followed by the name of the file including the extension. We should be careful with using this becasue it cannot be undone. There is no safety net such as a recycling bin when using this command.
    34. Why should I use version control? 
        Version control creates almost like a time machine. It allows users to return to various previous states of a project when used correctly. Using version control, to a point, is a good way of having a back up plan should things get ruined later on.
    35. How often should I commit to github?
        Commiting to Github should be done any time there is a significant change or a point worth holding onto.
    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github?
        When you type "git push origin <ourFirstName-lastName>" it will push our repo up to Github.
    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow.
        There's a few steps to Lambda's git flow. They are: Fork, Collaborate, Clone, Branch, Commit, Push, PR, Review. You would first fork the project from Github, then add your TL as a collaborator on the project, then you would want to clone it into your working directory. Next you want to create a working branch using your first and last name, commit any changes and push them up to Github. Finally submit a Pull Request, PR, and add your TL as a reviewer. Your TL will review the PR and merge it once their done.
